      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I love seeing an idea in my mind come to life. Making
        software is the perfect realization of this for me as
        it's the most mutable and living design one could
        implement. I also have a passion for the biological sciences,
        especially genetics and evolution. These inspire my ideals
        for software that can adapt to ever-changing needs.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Augusta, Georgia, I've lived in Tulsa, 
         Oklahoma and Olympia, Washingston for the last decade before
         recently coming back home to Georgia.
      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I follow many science and engineering video channels.
         I really enjoy spending time in nature. I dabble in designing
          virtual entities that learn via evolutionary techniques.     </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software or Web Developer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Atlanta, Georgia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development bridges the divide between developer and user
         succinctly on a universal platform. A new idea can be 
         in the hands of the user faster than most other software
         platforms. In other words, creativity and usability have a 
         close relationship in web development.
